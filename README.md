# Directory-Traversal-Attack
This project demonstrates how a Directory Traversal attack can exploit insecure file path handling in an FTP server to gain unauthorized access to restricted files.  The objective was to simulate an attack scenario, automate it using a Bash script (`attack.sh`), and identify which files were successfully accessed through directory traversal.
